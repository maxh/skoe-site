by Ralph and Kathy Shoe

Vera Janet Urness Skoe, a lifelong resident of the Nor-thome area, was born May 22, 1919, to Andrew and Annie Urness. Vera and her brother, Eldon, attended Bergville Grade School and Northome High School. She graduated from the Grand Rapids High School.
Vera was married to Earl Skoe at the Hope Lutheran Church in Northome on June 18, 1939, where they were faithful, active members for more than 30 years. Following their marriage, Vera and Earl lived in "the cabin" on South Island Lake road now owned by Welsh from the Twin Cities. Later they also lived in Alvwood and on the former Urness farm (now the Estabrooks farm) before buying a home in Northome in 1945 to be near the railroad.
From 1946 until 1970 Vera taught Sunday school and release time school and als'o worked with the cherub and junior choirs and was an adult choir member for many years. She was active in the Ladies' Aid and served on the church council.
Vera was involved in the Northome community and was a member of the American Legion Auxiliary for over 30 years; she was a Girl Scout leader, a member and officer of the Northome Parent-Teacher Association and helped found the Ita-Bel-Koo Day Activity Center. Vera was a very compassionate and kind person and was often the first one to arrive with food or assistance when there was a death in a family or other emergency.
Earl and Vera were the parents of four children, three sons and one daughter: Ralph, Irene, Wayne and Paul. The children attended school in Mizpah and Northome.
Vera and Earl celebrated their 50th anniversary in June 1989. Vera died in the Northome Nursing Home on January 6, 1995, just six weeks after Earl's death.
