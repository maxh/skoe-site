            December 8, 2004 at 11:50 p.m in Lancaster, California. The funeral 
            service held on Tuesday, December 14 at the Riverside National Memorial 
            Cemetery where Stanley was laid to rest with military honors. Pastor 
            Bill Vaughan led the mourners in a loving celebration of Stanley's 
            life. 
            <p>Stanley Oliver Skoe was born on April 22, 1915 at Bay View Farm 
              on Island Lake in Ardenhurst Township, Itasca County, MN (where 
              Ralph and Kathy Skoe now live). His father, Ener Erik Skoe had emigrated 
              from Telemark, Norway, in 1882. His mother O'lina Marie &quot;Lena&quot; 
              Torrisdatter Olson emigrated from Hedmark, Norway, in 1890. Stanley 
              joined his two brothers, Earl and Stanton, and his sister Bena on 
              the farm. Seven more children were born later, Marie, Viola, Emilie, 
              Ray, Gladys, Russel and Will (Gordie). The family lived on the farm 
              continuously, except for two years, until his mother died in 1939 
              and his father in 1945.</p>
            <p>Stanley was baptized as a child and confirmed in the Lutheran Faith 
              in 1929.</p>
            <p>He started first grade at Bergville School in the fall of 1921, 
              and graduated from there in the spring of 1931 as a sophomore. Bergville 
              was one of the only consolidated schools in the area that included 
              9' and 10' grades. He followed Earl, Stanton and Bena to Grand Rapids, 
              65 miles away, to graduate from high school there in 1933. He received 
              $10.00 in state aid and worked for the rest of his room, board, 
              and spending money.</p>
            <p>After graduating from high school, he returned to Northome and 
              logged with his brother, Stanton, for several years. He enlisted 
              in the army and was stationed in Fort Sill, OK in 1942. He received 
              an Honorable Medical Discharge. After that, he worked on the Alcan 
              Highway and in Newfoundland. Later he moved to CA. There married 
              June McKeegan in 1944. He worked in CA and continued to work for 
              sometime after that with his brother, Stanton, logging in MN.</p>
            <p>In 1953, he married Rosalia Sternberg. They moved to Anaheim in 
              1956. Later they built a house in San Leandro.</p>
            <p>Stanley worked for Ralph N. Brodie Company, later bought out by 
              Rockwell, and later by Brooks Instrument, Division of Emerson Electric.</p>
            <p>Stan retired in 1981. After retirement he continued to do some 
              work at home rebuilding engines. He enjoyed working with redwood 
              burl and making furniture. He collected and polishing stones. Many 
              of his family have beautiful redwood burl items and quartz clocks 
              to remember him by.</p>
            <p>Rose passed away in 1981. It was time for him to decide if he would 
              move back to MN or if he should stay in CA. After a heart-to-heart 
              talk with Barbara and her family, he decided to stay in CA. He bought 
              property at Big Bear and built his house there. After 10 years at 
              Big Bear, his grandson, Craig and wife, Laura, built a house for 
              him near theirs, near Lancaster in Leona Valley. His constant companions 
              have been Smokey, Dollar and Katie.</p>
            <p>Stan, as he is now called, is survived by his step-daughter, Barb 
              McConnachie; step-grandsons, Craig (Laura) McConnachie, Glen, Mike, 
              and step-granddaughters, Tracy, Diana and step-great grandsons,
